# Plotly-Dash-Google-Sheet
Connect multiple Google Sheet docs into Plotly / Dash framework in order to create graphs of quality air parameters. This solutions for me was very useful to create nice dashboard from every Google Sheet with no experience in coding

For personal use I collect IOT data like temperature, Co2, pm10 and pm25 on different Google Sheet; one for the living room, one for the bedroom, my parents house outdoor, my balcony outdoor and so on. 
My need was to collect all these data in one place in order to create a live dashboard with an auto-refresh to keep track of the enviromental conditions.

I used pyCharm, Plotly, Dash, Pandas, gspread to collect all the sheets and plot graphs.
